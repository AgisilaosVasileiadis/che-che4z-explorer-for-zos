// This file is providing the test runner to use when running extension tests.
// By default the test runner in use is Mocha based.
//
// You can provide your own test runner if you want to override it by exporting
// a function run(testsRoot: string, clb: (error: Error, failures?: number) => void): void
// that the extension host can call to run the tests. The test runner is expected to use console.log
// to report the results back to the caller. When the tests are finished, return
// a possible error to the callback or null if none.

import * as testRunner from "vscode/lib/testrunner";

// You can directly control Mocha options by configuring the test runner below
// See https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/wiki/Using-mocha-programmatically#set-options
// for more info
testRunner.configure({
    ui: "tdd", // the TDD UI is being used in extension.test.ts (suite, test, etc.)
    useColors: true, // colored output from test results
});
